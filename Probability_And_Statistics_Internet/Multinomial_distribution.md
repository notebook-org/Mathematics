# Multinomial distribution
* In probability theory, the multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution.
* For example, it models the probability of counts for each side of a k-sided die rolled n times.
* For n independent trials each of which leads to a success for exactly one of k categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability.
